What is OpenRTS?
OpenRTS is a 3D real-time strategy game engine. It's coded in Java 1.8, powered by jMonkeyEngine 3, and is open-source.

OpenRTS intends to support any kind of common real-time strategy gameplay, design and control, providing its own editor and a versatile data structure.

The project also wants to be a pool of RTS resources, giving access to a large and free-to-use set of maps, models, sounds, armies' data, and gameplays.

OpenRTS is still under development. There is a long way to go and a huge and growing TODO list. We will be glad to receive any of your contributions!

Watch the engine in action!

How to set up?
The project uses Gradle to support any IDE, or none.

Just clone the repository, then at the command-line in the clone's root directory run "./gradlew run" (or "gradlew.bat run" on windows).

You want to set up in your favorite IDE like jMonkey SDK or Eclipse? Simple! Please follow this page of the wiki.

The engine is set by default with a test dataset and some example maps you can load.

F1 : Game Mode (static iso camera)
F2 : Editor Mode
F3 : First Person view (for testing purpose)
